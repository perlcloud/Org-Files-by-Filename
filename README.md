## Organize Files By Filename
Organize files into folders by extracting part of the filename to be used as the folder name.

## Example
Say you have many files with the following naming convention:
Project-Name_Product-ID_unique-id.ext
By telling the program to split the file name on _ and that you want the 2nd part
as your folder name, all files will be organized into folders by Product-ID.

This is intended to be easy to use, but is not yet a finished product...
